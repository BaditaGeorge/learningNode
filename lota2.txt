Batman is one of the greatest heroes that ever existed, it's the dark knight
It's the Gotham City's Protector, it's the one that fight for justice and only for justice
He is just a mortal man, but that makes what he does even more amazing
He is strong, he is human physic peak, he is a martial artist
He is the greatest detective alive, and one of the smartest person on the Earth
Batman is a force of nature, he can fight Gods, and win
He is also immortal, Bruce Wayne may die one day, but Batman is more than that
Batman is a force, Batman exists and will exist through somebody that wants to do something good
To make everything great again.
